This is simply a small personal project of mine, where I get to have my own website, and also get to show what I have done.

## Motivation
As stated above, I want to get some experience with web development (and also some practice for COMP3900 lmao). 

I also want to show all the things I have worked with in the past, as I have a bad tendency of either forgotting that I did them, or just *straight up losing the source code for them* (I'm not even kidding, Year 12 me was a bit of an idiot with TTKOF. At this point I'm just glad I have a final build at least, and its not half bad for a SDD major project). This way, I can at least preserve what little is left of them.

## Frameworks used
- React.js, to make developing the front end a little easier and less repetitive.
  I mainly used the following React-related frameworks as part of this website:
    - react v18.3.1
    - react-scripts v5.0.1 (has a few handy commands that makes development easier)
    - react-router v7.1.5
- tailwindcss v3.4.17 (Streamlines the CSS part of development thankfully, I remember when I was coding in a .css file like a madman back in Year 10 for an IPT project)
- gh-pages v6.2.0 (not a framework so much as it is just a tool used for convenience to push the production build of the website to the repository)
