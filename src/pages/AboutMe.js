          Hello, my name is Ar-196, and this is my website, which I made mainly 
          to mess around with web development. 
          <br /><br />
          There are also a few projects from high school which I haven't maintained properly, 
          but would still like to show nonetheless.
          <br /><br />
          I would also like to show a few more things, 
          like future projects, and other things that I have done.
