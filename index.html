        <p> Hello, my name is Ar-196, and this is my website, which I made mainly </p>
        <p> to mess around with web development. There are also a few projects from </p>
        <p> high school which I haven't maintained properly, but would still like to </p>
        <p> show nonetheless. I would also like to show a few more things, like future </p>
        <p> projects, and other things that I have done. </p>
